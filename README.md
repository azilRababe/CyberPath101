# Cybersecurity Tools Cheat Sheet

## Overview

This repository is a structured and continuously updated cybersecurity cheat sheet.  
It is designed for beginners who are starting a cybersecurity career and need a clear reference for tools, commands, and workflows used in real environments.

The content is based on my learning journey through TryHackMe and other cybersecurity resources.  
Since I could not find a single well structured and beginner friendly cheat sheet, I decided to build one myself and keep it public for other newcomers.

This repository is updated daily as I learn new tools and techniques.

## Purpose

- Provide a practical cheat sheet for common cybersecurity tools
- Help beginners understand how tools are used in real scenarios
- Serve as a quick reference during labs, CTFs, and learning paths
- Support learning without giving direct answers to platform questions

No TryHackMe answers are included.  
However, the cheat sheets are detailed enough to help you understand concepts and solve challenges on your own.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to closely follow the **TryHackMe Premium Cyber Security Learning Path**.

Each section corresponds to a learning stage and includes tools commonly used in that phase.

Each tool file typically contains:

- Tool description
- Common commands
- Practical usage examples
- Notes and tips

## Who This Repo Is For

- Beginners starting in cybersecurity
- TryHackMe learners
- Students preparing for labs, CTFs, or interviews
- Anyone who wants a structured reference for cybersecurity tools

## How to Use This Repository

1. Follow the folders in order if you are new
2. Read the tool cheat sheet before using it in a lab
3. Use it as a reference when stuck, not as a shortcut
4. Combine it with hands on practice for best results

## Disclaimer

All tools and techniques documented here must be used ethically and legally, only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
